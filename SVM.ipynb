    "The goal of a support vector machine is to find  the optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin of the training data. The first thing we can see from this definition, is that a SVM needs training data, which means it is a supervised learning algorithm. It is also important to know that SVM is a classification algorithm, which means we will use it to predict if something belongs to a particular class.\n",
