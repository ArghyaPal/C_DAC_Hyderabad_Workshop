Participants are advised to download / clone this repository and create a virtual environment for installing the dependencies required for running this code.

#Creating Virtual environment

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

$ pip install virtualenv
$ cd my_project_folder
$ virtualenv venv

To begin this virtual environment, the above created one should be activated.
$ source venv/bin/activate

If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it:
$ deactivate
