# CDAC Hyderabad Workshop

This folder contains ipython notebooks and the corresponding required datasets for the following:

i) SVM. 
ii) k Nearest Neighbors.
iii) Linear Regression.
iv) k-Means Clustering.
v) Boosting / Ensemble methods.
vi) DBSCAN.

The aim of this exercise is to give the participants a fundamental understanding of traditional Machine Learning techniques used in the pre-Deep Learning era for solving various problems. Participants are advised to download / clone this repository and create a virtual environment for installing the dependencies required for running this code.

#Creating Virtual environment

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

$ sudo pip install virtualenv <br />
$ cd my_project_folder <br />
$ virtualenv venv <br />

To begin this virtual environment, the above created one should be activated <br />
$ source venv/bin/activate <br />

If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it <br />
$ deactivate <br />

# Installing required dependencies:

1) Numpy : $sudo apt-get install python-numpy <br />
2) Scipy : $sudo apt-get install python-scipy <br />
3) scikit-learn : Follow the instructions here : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html <br />
4) Pandas: $sudo apt-get install python-pandas <br />
5) Matplotlib: $sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib. <br />

Note: The above steps work on an Ubuntu distribution. If you have other Linux distribution, equivalent commands can be found online.

# Installing Jupyter
The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

$ sudo pip install jupyter

After installing Jupyter, launch it by <br/>
$ jupyter notebook

This will start the server and open in a web browser where you can run the above ipython notebooks. Advantage of Jupter notebooks is that particular sections of the code can be executed to see what it produces. Please note that it should be run sequentially starting from the beginning cell-wise.
