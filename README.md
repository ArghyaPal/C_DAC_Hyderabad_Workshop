# C_DAC_Hyderabad_Workshop

This folder contains ipython notebooks and the corresponding required datasets for the following:

i) SVM. 
ii) k Nearest Neighbors.
iii) Linear Regression.
iv) k-Means Clustering.
v) Boosting / Ensemble methods.
vi) DBSCAN.

The aim of this exercise is to give the participants a fundamental understanding of traditional Machine Learning techniques used in the pre-Deep Learning era for solving various problems. Participants are advised to download / clone this repository and create a virtual environment for installing the dependencies required for running this code.

#Creating Virtual environment

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

$ pip install virtualenv <br />
$ cd my_project_folder <br />
$ virtualenv venv <br />

To begin this virtual environment, the above created one should be activated <br />.
$ source venv/bin/activate <br />

If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it <br />:
$ deactivate <br />
