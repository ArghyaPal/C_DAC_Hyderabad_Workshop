    "# Introduction to k Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "In pattern recognition, the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (or k-NN for short) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm for more details about k-NN. It is highly recommended that you read this, before proceeding further with this lab exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, you deal with using inbuilt scikit learn SVM function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: *StackOverFlow* is programmer's best friend. If you have any doubts syntax related or otherwise, there is a high probability that someone would have already posted about it.\n",

    "We will use Breast cancer database provided by UCI Machine Learning repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data contains the breast cancer database. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names contains the details of what each attribute represents in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In short, Class <b> 2 </b> reprsents benign tumour and Class <b> 4 </b> represents malignant tumour.\n",
